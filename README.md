# WiFi Assisited Indoor SLAM

Visual (LiDAR/camera-based) SLAM systems deploy **compute** and **memory-intensive** search algorithms to detect "Loop Closures" to make the trajectory estimate globally consistent.
Instead, WAIS (<u>W</u>iFi <u>A</u>ssisted <u>I</u>ndoor <u>S</u>LAM) demonstrates using WiFi-based sensing can reduce this resource intensiveness drastically. 

By covering over 1500 m in realistic indoor environments and WiFi deployments, we showcase 4.3 x and 4 x reduction in compute and memory consumption compared to state-of-the-art Visual and Lidar SLAM systems. Incorporating WiFi into the sensor stack also improves the resiliency of the Visual-SLAM system. We find the 90th percentile translation errors improve by ~40% and orientation errors by ~60% compared with purely camera-based systems.

## Usage

This project directory contains four primary folders:
1. [python](./python): Helper code to extract path data collected in bag files 
2. [rviz](./rviz): RVIZ config file to visualize the path, AP positions, memory and compute trends. 
3. [launch](./launch): Use [wais.launch](./launch/wais.launch) contained inside to run the provided dataset
4. [src](./src): Contains the packages to run WAIS and monitor the memory and CPU information. 
    1. [cpu_monitor](./src/cpu_monitor): Publish CPU and RAM memory usage to individual topics. More information [here](https://github.com/alspitz/cpu_monitor). 
    2. [graph_rviz_plugin](./src/graph_rviz_plugin): QT plugin to plot lines graphs in RVIZ. More information [here](http://wiki.ros.org/graph_rviz_plugin). 
    3. [python-node](./src/python-nodes): Helper codes to process [P2SLAM datasets](https://wcsng.ucsd.edu/p2slam/), compute relative odometry, and plot path within python. 
    4. [rf_msgs](./src/rf_msgs): A clone of [rf_msgs](https://github.com/ucsdwcsng/rf_msgs) message type from WiROS package.
    5. [wifi_backend](./src/wifi_backend): Main package which contains the code to run WAIS's WiFi factor graph.
   
To install these packages, clone this repository and in the repository's root folder run `catkin build`: 

```
cd /home/user/
git clone https://github.com/ucsdwcsng/WAIS.git
cd WAIS
catkin build
```

Source the packages and confirm the paths are included:
```
source ./devel/setup.bash
echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
```

Download the dataset following the guidelines provided [below](#dataset-information-and-download) and change the bag path param name in the [launch file](./launch/wais.launch).
```
<!-- Download the dataset and add the path of the bag file here -->
<arg name="bag_path"    default = "path/to/dataset bag file" />
```

Run the launch file. This should open a termux window to play the bag file and an rviz window to display the data. Note the bag file will take a few minutes to open for the first time: 
```
roslaunch ./launch/wais.launch
```

## WiROS Platform

This work also open-sources the WiROS platform, which allows researchers to conveniently collect WiFi CSI information and process this information to extract AoA and ToF of the received signal. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/ucsdwcsng/WiROS).
